A retrospective into the product development lifecycle of our product created with Chada Tech.

# PDLC Short questions
**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs is an essential aspect to the PDLC.  User stories assist in providing perspective on what to create, for why, when, and for who. Since its relatively easy to interpret and revise, they are a intuitive way to communicate and summarize the functionality of the product.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

Approaching the development proccess requires multiple streams of questions to refine the infrastructure you will adapt to achieve optimal efficiency in development.  How large is your team, is your product going to require iterative design, will you be in constant communication with the users, etc.  Keep in mind the entire time that phases through agile can sometimes run simultaneously.  Using communication tacitcs employed by any agile framework is paramount to the success of any team oriented product development.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

**Use tabs instead of spaces.**

Just kidding, its quite simple really.  Become indispensable, hone in on the skills your good at and recognize the ones you're not, leverage your ability to learn, and be adaptable.  As long as you're willing to take the next step and firmly place your foot on the ground you will do great.
